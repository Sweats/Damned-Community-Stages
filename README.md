# What is this?

This repository contains all of the stages that we know of that has been created by the community for a game on Steam called Damned. This repository will be used by the Damned Workshop to find, download, and install community made stages into the game.

# Are these stages good?

We don't know. They can be terrible or extremely good. Anyone can upload their stages to this repository through a bot (which does not exist yet) in the Damned Discord. We do not screen these stages unless the author of the stage wants to try to get their stage to be part of the game officially.

# How can I get my stage added on here?

For now, ping Sweats and he can get your stage added on here.

In the very near future, people will be using a bot that can add their stage to this community repository.

# How can I get my stage added into the game officially so that every person has it?

Ping Sweats, Zulu, or HomingHead in the Damned Discord so we can talk about it with you. Be prepared to spend quite a bit of time making your stage polished.

# How do I install these community made stages?

For now this is how you do it:

1. Click a stage that you are interested in and download it.

2. Open the Damned Workshop and click on "Mapping Tools".

3. Click on "Load From Package" and find the zip file that you downloaded in the previous step then press "Ok".

4. Click on "Add Stage To List".

5. Click on "Modify Stages".

That is all there is to it.
